Differences between Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, Selenium Grid.

Selenium IDE: 
	Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the major tool in the Selenium Suite.
	Selenium IDE is implemented as a Firefox Add-On and as a Chrome Extension. 
	It is the simplest framework in the Selenium Suite.
	Selenium IDE allows for recording, editing and debugging of functional tests.

Selenium WebDriver:
	Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that accepts commands and sends them to a browser. 
	Selenium WebDriver, an interface to write instructions that work interchangeably across browsers.
	It is implemented through a browser-specific driver. 
	It controls the browser by directly communicating with it. 
	Selenium WebDriver supports Java, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby.
	
Selenium Grid
	Selenium Grid is a server that allows tests to use web browser instances running on remote machines. 
	With Selenium Grid, one server acts as the central hub. Tests contact the hub to obtain access to browser instances. 
	The hub has a list of servers that provide access to browser instances (WebDriver nodes), and lets tests use these instances. 
	Selenium Grid allows running tests in parallel on multiple machines and to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally (instead of in each individual test).
