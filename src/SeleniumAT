 What is Selenium? How it is useful in Automation Testing?

Selenium is an open-source framework widely used for automating web browsers. 
It provides a suite of tools and libraries that enable developers and testers to automate browser actions and simulate user interactions with web applications. 
Selenium supports multiple programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, making it versatile and accessible to a broad range of users.

Automation testing refers to the practice of using software tools and scripts to execute test cases and validate the functionality of an application automatically. 
Selenium is particularly popular in the field of automation testing due to its various features and capabilities.

Selenium Uses in Automation:

	Selenium allows you to automate browser tasks, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating through pages, and extracting data. 
	It can interact with elements on a web page just as a user would, enabling comprehensive testing of web applications.
	
	Since Selenium supports multiple web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge, it enables cross-browser testing. 
	Test scripts can be written once and executed on different browsers to ensure consistent behavior and identify browser-specific issues.
	
	Selenium integrates well with various testing frameworks, such as JUnit, TestNG, and PyTest, providing a structured approach to test development and execution.
	
	Selenium provides a wide range of methods for locating elements on a web page based on attributes like ID, class, name, XPath, CSS selectors, and more. 
	
	Selenium allows you to write test scripts in multiple programming languages, enabling teams to use their preferred language or choose the one that suits their project requirements.
